# Reflector.js

!! Pleasse note this is work in progress, bugs are aplenty !!

Reflector.js is a practical tool designed to pinpoint whether service-related issues or network problems are causing slowdowns, all without necessitating comprehensive access. This proves especially advantageous for diagnosing and gauging service issues across large-scale networks

Once the client-side script is configured, it intercepts all XHRequests matching your seervice URL, subsequently measuring the volume and speed of data the client receives. On capturing a request, the tool initiates data requests from an alternate service, referred to as a "reflector", and compares data speed measurements. If the primary service delivers data at a slower rate than our reflector, it implies a potential issue with the main service; thusly ruling out network issues, defining the problem scope, and better directing engineer efforts.

It's important to note that measurements commence only once the data begins to arrive; any warm-up period is disregarded.

The measurement outcomes are transformed into boxplots for both the service and individual reflectors within a set time frame, and then relayed through a callback. This client-side data can be gathered and, for instance, forwarded to a data collection service like Azure Monitor for further analyses.

The project has two main parts:

1. A server script (`reflector-server.js`): This script acts as our reflector service. It's like a special server that responds to data requests with random amounts of data.

2. A client script (`reflector.js`): This script measures the speed at which data comes from our main service and the reflector(s). It does this by intercepting XMLHttpRequests (XHR) to the main service, and "mirroring" these requests to the reflector service(s). These mirrored requests ask the reflector service(s) for a small amount of data which we can then use for our measurements.

## Impact on Services

This data mirroring process won't usually impact your services since they usually run on different connections, modern browsers can have up to 6 TCP connections per domain. This means that our mirrored requests won't block requests to the original service. However, if bandwidth is a limiting factor, there could be some impact on your service's performance. You should consider this when setting up your reflector service and deciding how often to make mirrored requests.That being said, the amount of data requested from the reflector can be specified.

## Setup

### Server

Before you can use Reflector.js, you'll need to set it up. The server script runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which you'll need to install first. You also need to install the `express` and `cors` packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install express cors
```

In the server script (`reflector-server.js`), there's a configuration object (`config`) that you need to update:

- `allowedDomain`: Enter the URL of the website that's allowed to use the reflector server. 
- `maxTotalSize`: This is the maximum size of data (in bytes) that the server can send back. It's currently set to 1 kilobyte (1024 bytes). You can change it if you want.
- `port`: This is the port number that the server listens to.
- `useHttps`: If you want to use a secure connection (HTTPS), set this to `true`. Otherwise, leave it as `false`.
- `certPath`, `keyPath`, `caPath`: If you're using HTTPS, you need to provide paths to your SSL certificate, private key, and CA bundle.

To run the server, use this command:

```bash
node reflector-server.js
```

### Client

The client script (`reflector.js`) runs in the browser. It also has a configuration object (`config`) that you need to update:

- `originalServiceHostname`: This is the hostname of the main service

 that you want to measure.
- `reflectorServiceURLs`: These are the URLs of your reflector servers. You can have more than one reflector if you want.
- `timeboxInterval`: This is how often (in milliseconds) you want to receive updates via the callback.
- `minMeasurements`: This is the minimum number of measurements you need to create a boxplot.
- `callback`: This is a function that returns the boxplot data. By deefault it just prints the data to the console. But you can replace this function to do something more useful. For example, you can send the data to a data collection service like Azure:

To use the client script, include it in your HTML like this:

```html
<script src="reflector.js"></script>
```

Remember, Reflector.js can only measure how quickly data comes from a service if it's actually receiving some data. So, make sure your services and reflector are sending data back!

Happy measuring!
